# K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to perform **K-Means clustering** for unsupervised machine learning using Python.  
It helps identify natural groupings in data based on feature similarity.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The notebook `kclustering.ipynb` applies K-Means clustering using standard Python libraries.  
It includes steps for:
- Data preprocessing
- Selecting the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method)
- Model training using `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`
- Visualization of clusters

## 📂 Files
- **kclustering.ipynb** — Main Jupyter notebook containing all steps and visualizations.
- **requirements.txt** — Required Python dependencies.
- **.gitignore** — Ignores unnecessary files (cache, system files, etc.).

## 🧩 Requirements
Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/K-Means-Clustering.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook kclustering.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Example Output
The notebook includes visualization plots showing distinct cluster boundaries and centroid positions.
